# Harsh Shah Analytics Portfolio


# [Project-1: Customer Segmentation (Predictive Analytics - Unsupervised)](https://github.com/SHAH-X/Customer_Segmentation.git)

* Segmented customers based on spending habits using transactional data, using K-means clustering in Python. Applied data transformation and dimensionality reduction to improve the results of clustering.
* Utilised data visualisation and silhouette score to evaluate the clusters. Conducted statistical analysis to create pen profiles for five clusters

# [Project-2: Purchase Prediction for Financial Product (Predictive Anlaytics - Supervised)](https://github.com/SHAH-X/Purchase_Prediction.git)

* Analysed past marketing campaign dataset using Python to predict client purchase decisions with an accuracy of 83.5%.
* Pre‐processed data through exploratory data analysis, removed outliers and missing values, and performed standardization and feature engineering.
* Built and evaluated performance of five ML classifier models‐Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K‐NN, Naive Bayes to identify the best prediction model based on business use case.
* Trained and deployed the selected model for implementation. Provided business recommendations for future analysis.

# [Project-3: Production Problem (Prescriptive Analytics)](https://github.com/SHAH-X/Production-Problem.git)

* Modelled a paper mill production problem as a Linear Programming problem by considering demand, cutting scheme, wastage, overproduction and production cost.
* Formulated the problem using decision variables, objective function, constraints and deviation variables.
* Used Goal Programming to produce the cheapest production plan that first minimises waste and any potential overproduction.
* Optimised the solution using Excel’s Solver.

# [Project-4: Cricket Analytics (Descriptive Analytics)](https://github.com/SHAH-X/Cricket-Analytics.git)

This was my first project in analytics, where I used Python and Tableau to manipulate data and generate insights respectively.
* Analysed data from approximately 70 matches by developing a comprehensive player analysis algorithm in Python and derived 20+ performance indicators.
* Created a Tableau dashboard to visualise the insights gathered from Python analysis.
* Used analysis results to pick top players in 40 matches of fantasy cricket, which increased the winning rate by about 20%.
